# nscala-time
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nscala-time/nscala-time.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nscala-time/nscala-time)

A new Scala wrapper for Joda Time.  This project forked from [scala-time](https://github.com/jorgeortiz85/scala-time/ "scala-time") since
it seems that scala-time is no longer maintained.


## INSTALLATION

Add the following to your sbt build (for Scala 2.9.1, Scala 2.9.2, Scala 2.9.3, and Scala 2.10.x!):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.nscala-time" %% "nscala-time" % "0.6.0"
```

Latest stable release is `0.6.0`.


## USAGE

This is mostly a convenience wrapper around the Joda Time libraries, adding
more pleasant syntax like operators for addition, subtraction, and comparison.
Also, most fields usually available as `getField` are now simply available as
`field`, following the Scala convention. Some instances of `asX` or `toX` have
also been shortened.


### Import
```scala
import com.github.nscala_time.time.Imports._
```


### Date/Time Operations
```scala
DateTime.now + 2.months // returns org.joda.time.DateTime = 2009-06-27T13:25:59.195-07:00

DateTime.nextMonth < DateTime.now + 2.months // returns Boolean = true

DateTime.now to DateTime.tomorrow  // return org.joda.time.Interval = > 2009-04-27T13:47:14.840/2009-04-28T13:47:14.840

(DateTime.now to DateTime.nextSecond).millis // returns Long = 1000

2.hours + 45.minutes + 10.seconds
// returns com.github.nscala_time.time.DurationBuilder
// (can be used as a Duration or as a Period)

(2.hours + 45.minutes + 10.seconds).millis
// returns Long = 9910000

2.months + 3.days
// returns Period
```


### Fluent interface
```scala
DateTime.now // returns org.joda.time.DateTime = 2009-04-27T13:25:42.659-07:00

DateTime.now.hour(2).minute(45).second(10) // returns org.joda.time.DateTime = 2009-04-27T02:45:10.313-07:00
```

## MOTIVATION

The Java Date and Calendar libraries are largely inadequate. They are mutable, not thread-safe, and very inconvenient to use.

The Joda Time library is a great replacement for Java's Date and Calendar classes. They're immutable by default, have a much
richer and nicer API, and can easily be converted to Java's Date and Calendar classes when necessary.

This project provides a thin layer of convenience around the Joda Time libraries, making them more idiomatic to use within Scala.
