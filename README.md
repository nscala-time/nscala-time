A new Scala wrapper for Joda Time.  This project forked from [scala-time](https://github.com/jorgeortiz85/scala-time/ "scala-time") since
it seems that scala-time is no longer maintained.


## Installation

Add the following to your sbt build (Scala 2.10.x, 2.11.x and 2.12.x):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.nscala-time" %% "nscala-time" % "2.16.0"
```

if you want to use previous versions, [you can find it from here](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.github.nscala-time%22)

## Use with [Ammonite](http://ammonite.io/)

In Ammonite REPL started type
```scala
@ import $ivy.`com.github.nscala-time::nscala-time:2.16.0`, com.github.nscala_time.time.Imports._ 
```

Binaries compiled with Scala 2.11.0-M8 are included.

### 0.6.0

Two major changes has been introduced in 0.6.0:

* [value class](https://github.com/nscala-time/nscala-time/issues/42)
* [update joda-time 2.3](https://github.com/nscala-time/nscala-time/issues/44)

Although I believe that these changes don't break your code, if you have some problems,
don't mind reporting the problem to [issues](https://github.com/nscala-time/nscala-time/issues).

### Version Numbering Policy

`x.y.z`, each letter is digit, format is used as version number.  Meanings of `x` is not determined yet.  
`y` means major-version.  Note that `y` is even number in any version of released `nscala-time`.  If `y` is odd, 
it's development and/or SNAPSHOT version.  `z` is mainly used for bug fix releases.  Currently, the value of `z` is 0
in most cases.

## Usage

This is mostly a convenience wrapper around the Joda Time libraries, adding
more pleasant syntax like operators for addition, subtraction, and comparison.
Also, most fields usually available as `getField` are now simply available as
`field`, following the Scala convention. Some instances of `asX` or `toX` have
also been shortened.


### Import
```scala
import com.github.nscala_time.time.Imports._
```


### Date/Time Operations
```scala
DateTime.now + 2.months // returns org.joda.time.DateTime = 2009-06-27T13:25:59.195-07:00

DateTime.nextMonth < DateTime.now + 2.months // returns Boolean = true

DateTime.now to DateTime.tomorrow  // return org.joda.time.Interval = > 2009-04-27T13:47:14.840/2009-04-28T13:47:14.840

(DateTime.now to DateTime.nextSecond).millis // returns Long = 1000

2.hours + 45.minutes + 10.seconds
// returns com.github.nscala_time.time.DurationBuilder
// (can be used as a Duration or as a Period)

(2.hours + 45.minutes + 10.seconds).millis
// returns Long = 9910000

2.months + 3.days
// returns Period
```


### Fluent interface
```scala
DateTime.now // returns org.joda.time.DateTime = 2009-04-27T13:25:42.659-07:00

DateTime.now.hour(2).minute(45).second(10) // returns org.joda.time.DateTime = 2009-04-27T02:45:10.313-07:00
```

## Motivation

The Java Date and Calendar libraries are largely inadequate. They are mutable, not thread-safe, and very inconvenient to use.

The Joda Time library is a great replacement for Java's Date and Calendar classes. They're immutable by default, have a much
richer and nicer API, and can easily be converted to Java's Date and Calendar classes when necessary.

This project provides a thin layer of convenience around the Joda Time libraries, making them more idiomatic to use within Scala.
